About NYU

   Since its founding in 1831, NYU has been an innovator in higher
   education, reaching out to an emerging middle class, embracing an urban
   identity and professional focus, and promoting a global vision that
   informs its 20 schools and colleges.

   Today, that trailblazing spirit makes NYU one of the most prominent and
   respected research universities in the world, featuring top-ranked
   academic programs and accepting fewer than one in eight undergraduates.
   Anchored in New York City and with degree-granting campuses in Abu
   Dhabi and Shanghai as well as 12 study away sites throughout the world,
   NYU is a leader in global education, with more international students
   and more students studying abroad than any other US university.

   NYU students come from nearly every state and 133 countries, and the
   university draws upon the diverse backgrounds of our faculty, staff,
   and students, ensuring its scholarship and teaching benefit from a wide
   range of perspectives. NYU takes seriously its role as an engine of
   social mobility, and stands out among the top US universities in its
   representation of low-income and first-generation students within its
   community.

   Now among the largest private universities in the US, NYU provides a
   rigorous, demanding education to more than 65,000 students and
   undertakes $1 billion in research annually. It counts among its faculty
   recipients of the highest scholarly honors and is a top producer of
   patents and revenue from licensing among US universities. NYU has a
   vast network of alumni who have gone on to succeed across professions,
   from the sciences to the arts and government, throughout the world.

Message from the President
