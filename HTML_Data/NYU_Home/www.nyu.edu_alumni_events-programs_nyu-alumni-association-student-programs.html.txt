The NYU Alumni Association (NYUAA) is committed to engaging with NYU students past, present, and future and offers programs to connect with incoming and current students. Alumni can offer mentorship through Violet Talks and other programs through the Student Alumni Council. Check out our current student programs below.


Dinner with Six is a series of dinners hosted by alumni for students. They are a great opportunity for alumni and students to connect over shared interests, career goals, affinities, and more all while sharing a great meal!
Learn more about hosting a Dinner with Six.


The NYU Alumni Association manages over 50 New Student Send-Off events each summer all across the world to welcome the incoming class of students to the NYU family. Hosted by current NYU families and alumni, these casual receptions bring together new NYU families in a geographic region for connection before starting at NYU. Students meet each other, learn what to expect when they arrive on campus, and can get any last-minute questions answered.


The NYU Student Alumni Council (SAC) helps students connect with alumni, provides leadership opportunities, participates in efforts that support the NYU Alumni Association and the NYU community, and promotes NYU pride amongst students. This select group of NYU students has special access to resources and guidance with staff and alumni through serving the NYU alumni community. Students in SAC will take pride in being the keepers of NYU traditions and legacy.
The NYUAA works closely with student affairs and NYU global sites on programs throughout the year including:
