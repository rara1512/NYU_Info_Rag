Students from around the world choose to attend NYU for a wide variety of reasons. Here are some perspectives from recent students.
Since its inception, NYU has been a distinctly urban university, one that NYU founder, Albert Gallatin, called a university that is "in and of the city." Today, the University has evolved into a university that is "in and of the great cities of the world." NYU's global network comprises three degree-granting portal campuses: one in the heart of New York City, a second in Abu Dhabi, and a third in Shanghai.
NYU's more than 50,000 students study more than 4,000 courses in hundreds of degree and non-degree programs at locations around the world. In addition to the three portal campuses, students can study abroad at global academic centers in Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, Madrid, London, Paris, Prague, Tel Aviv, Sydney, and Washington, DC.
 
 
NYU’s campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai offer an assortment of  undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees to suit a variety of academic, professional, and personal interests.
