NYU Alumni Access is a program that provides alumni in the metro New York region and Los Angeles with exclusive and experiential events that emphasize the value and power of the NYU network. The events are open to all NYU alumni and typically sell out very quickly. Programs range from smaller, more intimate gatherings of 30 people (e.g. private museum tour) to larger 75+ groups (e.g. show and talkback with an alumni cast member). Please check back often and update your contact information to stay informed of upcoming events.
