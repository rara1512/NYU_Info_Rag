New York University (NYU) is committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy statement governs the collection and use of information collected through official NYU websites and other NYU digital properties.
This is a general statement of NYU's position on digital privacy. For information about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and NYU's responses to the regulation, please refer to NYU IT's GDPR policy page:

NYU will not collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit our websites or digital properties unless you voluntarily provide us with that information. NYU may request personally identifiable information from you if you wish, for example, to access a password-protected website, join a mailing list, or engage in a payment transaction. NYU may use that information for such purposes as fulfilling your requests for our information or services, communication information that may be of interest to you, and conducting research surveys. NYU will not share your information with third parties except as set forth below under "Sharing Your Information."

When you visit NYU websites and other NYU digital properties, we may automatically collect and store information sent by your web browser, such as IP addresses (i.e., the Internet address of your computer) in server logs. We also collect standard information about your computer (such as your web browser and operating system) and about your usage of our websites and digital properties (such as pages visited, length of visit, and search queries). This information, which does not identify your personally, is aggregated and used to help diagnose problems and suggest points for improving parts of our website and digital properties. For example, we utilize statistical software to identify which parts of our website are most heavily used and which portion of our audience comes from within the NYU network.

These cookies are used to remember your preferences or to track statistics on usage of various portions of NYU websites and digital properties. Our use of cookies does not involve the collection of personally identifiable information.
You can choose not to accept cookies by selection settings on your web browser that block or restrict the use of cookies. You can also delete cookies that have been placed on your computer or device.

In cases when NYU has personally identifiable information (PII) about you, we will not sell, rent, or share that PII and will treat it in compliance with our Personally Identifiable Information Policy and with other related institutional policies and federal and state laws and regulations.

NYU may contract with third party vendors to show our advertisements on non-NYU websites and digital properties. NYU and third party vendors with whom we contract may use cookies and web beacons to serve our ads based on your prior visit(s) to NYU websites and digital properties and to assess the effectiveness of our ads. This is also called Targeted Advertising or Interest-Based Advertising.
These techniques use only non-personally identifiable information, and you may opt out of behavioral advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out.

NYU has implemented reasonable physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure all information we collect online against loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.

 New York University Bulletins are available in both electronic and printed versions. The University makes every effort to keep both current. 
However, should there be a substantive difference between versions of the bulletin for a particular school, the printed bulletin is the official document. If you require further clarification, please call the Office of the Dean for that school.
