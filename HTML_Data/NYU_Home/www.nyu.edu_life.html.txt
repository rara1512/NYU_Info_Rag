Albeit untraditional, NYU is primarily located in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and downtown Brooklyn where there’s no doubt that the neighborhoods feel like a community.  Many of NYU’s academic and administrative buildings and freshman residence halls border Washington Square Park.  The sidewalks are full of students on their way to class, and members of the NYU community fill the restaurants, shops, and other businesses. Both on campus and off, the people of NYU are directly involved in the day-to-day excitement, culture, and opportunity of the city that serves as a very real extension of NYU’s campus and classrooms.
