Each Fall and Spring semester the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute hosts team hunts for NYU students, staff, faculty and researchers to meet, learn about each other's startups and interest areas, and join together as teams.
Looking to join a startup? Or looking to add a co-founder or collaborator to your team? Join us for an upcoming team hunt (sign up below!). This is a great way to find collaborators in advance of applying for the Startup Sprint, Startup Bootcamps, and/or the Berkley Center's Entrepreneurs Challenge! This is one of the only co-founder matching events hosted at NYU. So don't miss it!!!
 
Note: This event is only open to members of the NYU community - NYU students, faculty, staff and researchers. No prior startup experience is necessary!
Keep an eye on this section for upcoming team hunts.
