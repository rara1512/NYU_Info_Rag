NYU Tandon’s newest facility, the MakerGarage, is located in the Clocktower Building, a 1920s cast-concrete edifice in Downtown Brooklyn. It is a much-welcome addition, particularly for participants in Tandon’s Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program, which allows students to choose a hands-on project and work on it throughout much of their academic careers, and Tandon's student design and competition teams.
